# Abduction #

I have been updating the required Firefox version number for the [Firefox extension Abduction](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/3408/), which lets you save part (or all) or a Web page as a PNG file. The original author hasn't updated it since Firefox 3.5.

I've also added a couple bug fixes.
